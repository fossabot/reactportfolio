# Welcome To Spraggins Designs

#### This is my first React.js web app and also my Portfolio of skills and work

<!-- TABLE OF CONTENTS -->
This web app was built originally from a good friend of mine, and after many tireless weeks of work I managed to finish it into something I could call my own. 
Check the acknowledgements section, he is the first person I acknowledge for his help, work, kindness, and overall being a fellow programmer and gentleman. 

### Why I Made This Web App in React
* I managed to create something I am proud of, have learned a great deal about React.js from, and deploying it as well. 
* I made this for potential employers, to showcase I can create a React.js web app, and retire my old portfolio made in SASS
* I have been expanding my knowledge of frameworks. After mastering the basics, I went to Vue School and completed that in the Summer of 2021
* Since the fall of 2021 I have been taking courses and working on React and Angular
* If you have any questions, concerns or feedback please contact me through the email I provide below. 
* Thank you. 

### This Web App Portfolio Was Built With
* [React](https://reactjs.org)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* Visual Studio Code

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

* There are several known issues already in the main folder that need cleanup
* And of course I need to address the og link relâ€™s to properly work. 
* There are more fixes coming and anyone who can help, please reach out. 
* They are all quite minor, but overall I am very happy with what I have built, with the help from my friend too.
