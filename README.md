This web app was built from a forked template which I highly suggest anyone reading this to go check out and contribute if you can: https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaustubhai/

Here's why:
* I managed to create something I am proud of, have learned a great deal about React.js from, and deploying it as well from this man. 
* I made this for potential employers, so I hope the changes and amount of hard work and learning I put into this is for something and helps a company hire someone worth their while. 
* You should always contribute if you have the means and abilities, programmers are a community of like-minded individuals and I am so happy to have worked with him. 
* Thank you.
